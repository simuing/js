        Assignment Operators

        - Assignment
          x = y Meaning x = y

        - Addition Assignment
          x += y Meaning x = x + y

        - Subtraction assignment
          x -= y Meaning x = x - y

        - Multiplication assignment
          x *= y Meaning x = x * y

        - Division assignment
          x /= y Meaning x = x / y

        - Remainder assignment
          x %= y Meaning x = x % y

        - Exponentiation assignment
          x **= y Meaning x = x ** y

        - Left shift assignment
          x <<= y Meaning x = x << y

        - Right shift assignment
          x >>= y Meaning x = x >> y

        - Unsigned right shift assignment
          x >>>= y Meaning x = x >>> y

        - Bitwise AND assignment
          x &= y Meaning x = x & y

        - Bitwise XOR assignment
          x ^= y Meaning x = x ^ y

        - Bitwise OR assignment
          x |= y Meaning x = x | y
